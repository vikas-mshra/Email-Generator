# Project Title: Email Generator using LangChain and ChromaDB

## Overview

This project aims to automate the process of generating emails using LangChain and ChromaDB for managing and querying relevant data. The project is focused on creating personalized, structured emails by scraping web pages and intelligently combining key information into a professional communication format.

## Key Features

- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain to process large text data efficiently and generate meaningful responses for email communication.
- **ChromaDB Storage**: Stores portfolio links and project metadata in ChromaDB for quick querying based on the user's skills and experience.
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Automatically scrapes job descriptions from career pages and processes them into a structured format.
- **Portfolio Showcase**: Selects and showcases relevant portfolio projects based on the job description to enhance application effectiveness.
- **Job Skill Matching**: Queries skills mentioned in job descriptions and matches them with corresponding project links.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **ChromaDB**
- **Pandas**
- **FastAPI**
- **OnnxRuntime**
- **SQLAlchemy**
- **Tenacity**

## How It Works

1. **Web Scraping**: The project first scrapes a career page (e.g., from Nike's job listings) to extract relevant job descriptions.
2. **Text Processing**: LangChain processes the scraped text using a prompt-based template, extracting the key job details like role, required skills, and experience.
3. **Portfolio Querying**: The project uses ChromaDB to store the developer's portfolio links. Based on the job's required skills, the system queries the most relevant projects and includes them in the email.
4. **Email Generation**: Finally, a cold email is generated, showcasing relevant projects and highlighting the developer's experience.

## Flow of the Email Generation System

The image illustrates the flow of an automated email generation system using **LangChain** and **ChromaDB**. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Job Posting**:
   - The process starts with a job posting, which contains key details like the role, required skills, and job description. This is fed into the system.

2. **llama-3.1-70b-versatile Model**:
   - The **llama-3.1-70b-versatile** language model processes the job posting and extracts important details such as:
     - **Role** (e.g., "Software Engineer I")
     - **Experience** (e.g., "2+ years")
     - **Skills** (e.g., "JavaScript")

3. **Job Description in JSON Format**:
   - The extracted information is organized into a structured JSON format. This JSON contains the role, experience, skills, and a brief description of the job.

4. **ChromaDB (Vector Database)**:
   - The JSON data is then queried in **ChromaDB**, a vector database that stores detailed information about the user's profile (skills, projects, portfolio). Based on the job description, ChromaDB returns relevant details from the user’s profile that match the job requirements.

5. **llama-3.1-70b-versatile Model (Second Use)**:
   - The **llama-3.1-70b-versatile** model is called again to generate a cold email using the job description data and the user profile details fetched from ChromaDB.

6. **Cold Email Generation**:
   - A personalized cold email is generated on the user's behalf. This email includes relevant skills, experience, and portfolio projects, tailored specifically to the job posting.

---

This process effectively automates the task of creating personalized cold emails for job applications by leveraging **natural language processing (NLP)** and **vector database querying**. The system fetches relevant user information through ChromaDB and generates a coherent email with the help of the llama language model.
