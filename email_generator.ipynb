            "content='The first person to publish a paper on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often credited to be Alan Turing, a British mathematician, computer scientist, and logician. His paper, titled \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,\" was published in 1936 in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.\\n\\nHowever, the paper that is often considered the foundation of AI as a field is Turing\\'s 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" which was published in the journal Mind. In this paper, Turing proposed the Turing Test, a measure of a machine\\'s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.\\n\\nTuring\\'s work laid the foundation for the development of AI as a field of research, and his ideas continue to influence AI research to this day.\\n\\nOther notable early papers on AI include:\\n\\n* \"A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\" by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943), which introduced the concept of artificial neural networks.\\n* \"The Logical Theory of Automata\" by Stephen Kleene (1951), which introduced the concept of finite automata.\\n* \"A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence\" by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon (1956), which proposed the first AI research project and coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence\".\\n\\nThese papers, along with Turing\\'s work, helped establish AI as a field of research and laid the foundation for the development of modern AI systems.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 324, 'prompt_tokens': 45, 'total_tokens': 369, 'completion_time': 1.296, 'prompt_time': 0.011000887, 'queue_time': 0.005083534000000001, 'total_time': 1.307000887}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5c5d1b5cfb', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-075b9a49-8a83-4359-b004-b0fa4ff81c7c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 45, 'output_tokens': 324, 'total_tokens': 369}\n"
